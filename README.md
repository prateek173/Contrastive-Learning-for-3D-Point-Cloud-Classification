Contrastive Learning for 3D Point Cloud Classification
ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust and efficient 3D point cloud classification model. It leverages Depthwise Separable Convolutions and T-Net Light (Spatial Transformer Networks) for efficient feature extraction and spatial invariance. Additionally, it explores the use of self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance feature learning without heavy reliance on labeled data.

ðŸ§© Key Features
Efficient Feature Extraction:
Lightweight Depthwise Separable Convolutions reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy.

Robust Spatial Invariance:
T-Net Light modules (3Ã—3 and 64Ã—64 transformations) align point clouds to handle variations in rotation, scale, and translation.

Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning:
Pretraining the model with contrastive loss helps in learning robust features, reducing the need for large labeled datasets.

Comprehensive Evaluation:
Model performance evaluated on ModelNet10 using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
